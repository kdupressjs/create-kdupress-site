# Introduction

KduPress is composed of two parts: a minimalistic static site generator with a Kdu-powered [theming system](https://kdupress.web.app/theme/) and [Plugin API](https://kdupress.web.app/plugin/), and a [default theme](https://kdupress.web.app/theme/default-theme-config.html) optimized for writing technical documentation. It was created to support the documentation needs of Kdu's own sub projects.

Each page generated by KduPress has its own pre-rendered static HTML, providing great loading performance and is SEO-friendly. Once the page is loaded, however, Kdu takes over the static content and turns it into a full Single-Page Application (SPA). Additional pages are fetched on demand as the user navigates around the site.
