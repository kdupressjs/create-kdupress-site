# create-kdupress-site

Scaffolding a KduPress project

## Getting Started

### Run generator

In the desired folder, run the following command to start the KduPress site generator:

```shell
npx create-kdupress-site
# yarn create kdupress-site
```

This will create a scaffolded documentation site in the `docs` directory that is enclosed from the rest of the folder.

### Setup local environment

```shell
# Navigate into newly scaffolded docs directory
cd docs

# Install dependencies
npm install
# yarn install

# Start local dev server
npm run dev
```

By default, you should now see your scaffolded KduPress docs site at https://localhost:8080!
